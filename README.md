## üéØ Motivation

Climate change poses an unprecedented threat, manifesting in extreme weather, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem disruption. This project is driven by the urgent need for advanced, user-friendly tools to better understand, predict, and respond to these challenges. AI offers a powerful lens to analyze vast climate datasets, enabling data-driven strategies at local, regional, and global scales. We aim to democratize access to this critical information, empowering policymakers, researchers, and the public.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project demo.

### Prerequisites

*   Google Account (for Google Colab)
*   Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
*   Ngrok Account (free tier is sufficient for demo) and Authtoken (for stable URLs, optional for free tier).

### Running the Demo (Colab & Ngrok)

The primary way to experience the project is through the provided Google Colab notebook:

1.  **Open the Notebook:** Upload or open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colaboratory.
    [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](YOUR_COLAB_NOTEBOOK_LINK_HERE)  *(<-- Replace with your actual Colab link)*
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the cells tagged for installing required libraries (e.g., `pip install Flask flask-ngrok Plotly pandas requests tensorflow ...`).
3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Ngrok Authtoken:** If you have an Ngrok account, add your authtoken in the relevant Colab cell. This provides more stable connections. You can get it from the [Ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
    ```python
    # Example cell in Colab
    !ngrok authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN
    ```
4.  **Run the Flask App & Ngrok:** Execute the Python code cell that defines the Flask routes (`app.py` logic) and the cell that starts the Flask application and initiates the Ngrok tunnel.
    ```python
    # Example cell to run the app (simplified using flask-ngrok)
    from flask import Flask
    from flask_ngrok import run_with_ngrok # Make sure flask-ngrok is installed

    app = Flask(__name__)
    run_with_ngrok(app) # Wraps the app to run with ngrok

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        # Your dashboard logic here...
        # Example: return render_template('index.html', data=some_data)
        return "<h1>Climate Monitor Dashboard</h1>" # Replace with your actual dashboard rendering

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run() # No need to specify host/port when using flask-ngrok usually
    ```
    Or using `pyngrok`:
    ```python
    # Example using pyngrok
    from flask import Flask
    from pyngrok import ngrok
    import threading

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        # Your dashboard logic here...
        return "<h1>Climate Monitor Dashboard</h1>" # Replace with your actual dashboard rendering

    def run_flask():
      app.run(port=5000) # Run Flask on a specific port

    if __name__ == '__main__':
      # Set up ngrok tunnel before starting Flask
      public_url = ngrok.connect(5000) # Tunnel to port 5000
      print(f" * Dashboard running on {public_url}")
      print(f" * Local URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000")
      # Run Flask in a separate thread so ngrok can continue
      flask_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_flask)
      flask_thread.start()
      # Keep the main thread alive (or manage threads properly in your script)
      # ngrok.disconnect(public_url) # Optional: Disconnect when done
    ```
5.  **Access the Dashboard:** Look for the Ngrok URL (`https://*.ngrok-free.app` or similar) printed in the output of the Ngrok cell. Click this URL to open the live dashboard in your browser. Replace `[YOUR_NGROK_URL]` in the [Dashboard Preview](#Ô∏è-dashboard-preview-demo) section with this URL.

### (Optional) Local Installation

For local development or running outside Colab:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file)*
4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py # Or your main application script
    ```
5.  **Access Locally:** Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the port specified in your Flask app).
