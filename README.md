## Overview

This project aims to build a comprehensive system utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address the global challenge of climate change. By processing vast amounts of environmental data, the system provides tools for:

1.  **Monitoring:** Tracking key climate variables and environmental indicators in near real-time.
2.  **Prediction:** Forecasting climate trends, extreme weather events, and potential natural disasters.
3.  **Visualization:** Presenting complex data and insights through interactive dashboards for policymakers and the public.
4.  **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns that may signal environmental shifts or crises.
5.  **Mitigation:** Simulating policy impacts and recommending effective strategies (a long-term goal).

## Motivation

Climate change is one of the most critical challenges facing humanity, causing widespread impacts from extreme weather to biodiversity loss. This project is driven by the need for advanced tools that can help us understand, predict, and respond to these changes more effectively. AI offers a powerful way to extract actionable insights from complex climate data, enabling better decision-making at local, regional, and global levels.

## Key Features

*(Based on the full project vision)*

1.  **Climate Prediction Models:**

## Project Demo (Colab Notebook)

A simplified demonstration of core concepts is available in the following Google Colab notebook:

‚û°Ô∏è [`Project_BITD1.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PMHU1QkApckMZ8CeI7I63I0B8YYrZao_?usp=sharing)

**(If the notebook isn't directly linked, state: "See the `TestAIbyharshaniltuti.ipynb` file in this repository.")**

**The demo notebook covers:**

1.  **Setup:** Installs necessary libraries.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** Fetches recent hourly weather data (e.g., temperature, precipitation) for a specific location using the free Open-Meteo API.
3.  **Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Handles missing values and prepares data.
4.  **EDA & Visualization:** Creates time series plots, distribution plots (using Plotly), and a location map (using Folium).
5.  **Short-Term Forecasting:** Builds a simple LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict the next few hours of temperature based on past data.
6.  **Anomaly Detection:** Applies the Isolation Forest algorithm from Scikit-learn to identify unusual temperature readings.
7.  **Summary:** Presents the key outputs in a basic dashboard-like format.

**How to Run the Demo:**

1.  Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colaboratory.
2.  Run the cells sequentially using the "Run all" command or by executing each cell individually (`Shift + Enter`).
3.  Required libraries will be installed automatically in the first step.
4.  Observe the outputs (data tables, plots, maps, model results).

**Note:** This demo uses readily available APIs and focuses on short-term forecasting and basic anomaly detection. It serves as a proof-of-concept for the broader project vision.
